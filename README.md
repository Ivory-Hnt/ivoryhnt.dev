# My Personal Website

This is my personal website. Feel free to do what you would like with it. All the CSS is inside the HTML files, and it uses some tailwind and fontawesome icons.

## Notice

If you intend to make a website with this, please check out this: https://github.com/Sodiums-Templates/personal-website-template/tree/main as that is the template version that contains no copyrighted material, so you can feel at ease. It also includes some design improvements from my website. This template is also created by me. You are, of course, welcome to borrow any html, css or javascript elements from this github repo, as there is no template for blog pages.


**
If you use this as a template, please do not use any of my photos, and make sure to change all the text. You don't have to change the titles, headings, subheadings or footers. You MUST give credit to me if you use this website for personal or commercial use.**
